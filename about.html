            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                Code Phoropter is an open-source tool designed to help developers find their ideal code display settings through systematic A/B testing. 
                Just as an optometrist uses a phoropter to determine your optimal vision prescription, this tool helps you discover which fonts, sizes, 
                and colors make your code most readable and comfortable for extended coding sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project uses a tournament-style comparison system to progressively narrow down your preferences across multiple dimensions: 
                font family, size, weight, line height, and color scheme. Each comparison you make helps build a profile of your ideal coding environment.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Personal Background</h3>
            <p>
                As I've gotten older, I've noticed that reading code on screen has become more challenging than it used to be. 
                What once seemed perfectly readable now strains my eyes, especially during long coding sessions or under different 
                lighting conditions. The fonts and settings that worked well for me in my twenties no longer provide the same comfort 
                and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This realization led me to experiment with different fonts, sizes, and color schemes, but the sheer number of 
                combinations was overwhelming. Traditional "font showcases" show individual fonts in isolation, but don't help you 
                systematically compare options or account for how different settings interact with your specific screen, lighting 
                conditions, and visual needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted a tool that could help me methodically test different combinations in various contexts ‚Äì bright daylight, 
                dim evening light, different monitor types, and varying distances from the screen. The idea of using a systematic, 
                optometry-inspired approach emerged: rather than guessing or randomly trying settings, why not use the proven 
                "which is better, 1 or 2?" methodology that eye doctors have used for decades?
            </p>
            <p>
                Code Phoropter was born from this need ‚Äì a tool that acknowledges that code readability is highly personal and 
                context-dependent, and provides a scientific approach to finding your optimal settings through careful comparison 
                rather than guesswork.

            <h3>üîí Privacy & External Requests</h3>
            <p>
                This page and the main app run fully in your browser. However, some configurations may request resources from third‚Äëparty CDNs (e.g., web fonts or libraries), and those providers may collect telemetry or set cookies according to their own policies.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local processing:</strong> Comparisons and scoring run in your browser; no app‚Äëside analytics are sent.</li>
                <li><strong>External resources:</strong> Depending on settings, the app may load fonts or scripts from CDNs (e.g., Google Fonts, cdnjs) or self‚Äëhosted files under <code>/fonts/</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>System fonts:</strong> When using only system or self‚Äëhosted fonts, no external font requests are made.</li>
                <li><strong>GDPR considerations:</strong> Linking to Google Fonts via CSS can reveal your IP to Google. Many teams choose to self‚Äëhost fonts to avoid this.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> For maximum privacy, self‚Äëhost fonts (place WOFF/TTF files under <code>/fonts/</code>) and disable remote font loading. We can add a toggle to force ‚Äúlocal‚Äëonly‚Äù mode on request.
